Pure, virtuous, unadulterated programming bliss - hastily assembled C programs.

The C-Haste Library (libchaste)
===============================

License:
--------
See LICENSE file included. TL;DR - BSD 3 Clause. 


Main features:
--------------

Performance monitoring - tools around rdtsc made easy

Type safe command line options parser with super simple syntax. 

Powerful logging with runtime and compile time log level tuning. 

A string library to efficiently do useful string manipulations. 

Data structures: generic, type safe array and vector (linked list, bin tree and hash map coming soon)

Currently builds on:
    - Linux (Ubtuntu 12.10/13.04)

Targeted to build on: 
    - Linux/BSD/Darwin (OS X)
    - 32bit/64bit (64bit optimized)
    - ARM / x86


Obtaining the source: 
----------------------

The C-Haste library is available at https://github.com/mgrosvenor/libchaste 

- The master branch is a "stable" "release" candidate -- the bleeding edge - guaranteed compile and pass unit tests -- API may vary wildly. 
- Release branches are stable, tagged with the release ID. Incremental fixes to a release will be tags added to the release branch. Bug fixes only. No new features. No new APIs. 


Building
---------

Libchaste builds on both gcc 4.6 and clang 3.2 against the c11 standard with pedantic warnings and errors using the Posix 2008 system API. 

It includes a swathe of unit tests and infrastructure for making them all running and passing valgrind tests. 

- run build.sh to build a debug libcahste.a binary in the bin/ directory. 
- run build_release.sh to build a release binary libcahste.tar.bz
